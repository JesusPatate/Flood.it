# Flood.it

## The idea

Flood.it aims to release a scalable peer-to-peer text editor using web browsers. 
This project will use its own communication protocol over the new WebSocket technology with JavaScript, directly between browsers without the need of a central coordinator. In context of peer-to-peer, we will focus on a very flexible (partition tolerant and highly available) document editor web-application. To be scalable, the matter of consistency will be solved by an implementation of the probabilistic causal broadcast.
